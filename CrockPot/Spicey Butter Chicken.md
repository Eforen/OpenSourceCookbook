# Notes

## perperations
1. First time by the recipe 
  * The intensity of the spices overwhelmed the flavors.
  * The aromaz smelled amazing while cooking
  * The spice was slightly too strong for me and completely overpowered my partner's pallet
  * Next time I am going to try half the spices in recipe. 
  * Looking over the recipe I realized I may have added a tablespoon of cayenne instead of a half teaspoon
  * Next time I should try 1.25 tsp of curry powder and masala
