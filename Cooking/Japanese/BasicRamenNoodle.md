## Usage
Ramen noodles are a staple in Japanese cuisine. They are a type of noodle that is made from wheat flour, water, salt, and an alkaline mineral water called kansui. The alkaline mineral water gives the noodles their unique texture and flavor. Ramen noodles are typically served in a broth with various toppings such as sliced pork, green onions, and seaweed. They are a popular comfort food in Japan and are enjoyed by people of all ages.

## Characteristics
### High Hydration
High hydration noodles (35% and over):
* Generally easier to work with
* Won't suck up as much water/soup
* Won't get as soggy as quickly
* Will have a chewier texture

### Low Hydration
Low hydration noodles (30% and under):
* Very difficult to make at home
* Will suck up a lot of water/soup
* Will get soggy very quickly
* Will have a softer texture
* Will be more prone to breaking
* Will be more prone to sticking together or to the pot

## Recommended Uses
| Type of Ramen | Hydration Level |
| --- | --- |
| Tonkotsu Ramen | Low Hydration 30% or lower (don't try at home) |
| Sapporo Miso Ramen | High Hydration 35% - 40% |
| Shoyu Ramen | Mid - High Hydration 33%-40% |
| Shio Ramen | Mid - High Hydration 33%-40% |

## How to make it

Important note low hydration noodles are very likely to break your pasta machine. If you are making low hydration noodles you will need to hand roll them. Do not attempt to make low hydration noodles (below 33%) with a pasta machine.

### Makes 
40% hydration noodles

### Ingredients
* 500g Bread Flour
* 200g Cold, Filtered Water (40% of flour weight)
  * Addjust this number to get the desired hydration level
* 5g Sodium carbonate (Kansui) (1% of flour weight) (see [Sodium Carbonate](../Ingredients/SodiumCarbonate.md)) Substitute with 5g Potassium Carbonate (These will make a fermer snappier noodle but falls apart easier)
* 5g Kosher Salt (1% of flour weight)
* Potato Starch for dusting

### Tools Needed
* Oven
* Baking Sheet
* Foil or Parchment Paper as lining
* Pasta machine

### Directions
1. Add sodium carbonate and salt to the water and mix until dissolved. (This is your kansui)
2. Add the flour to a large mixing bowl.
3. Extreamly slowly add the water to the flour while mixing. Add some then mix, add some then mix.
   1. As you mix in the kansui, the dough will start to come together in little clumps.
   2. After all the kansui is added, rub the dough together to make equal sized clumps with equal hydration.
   3. Well hydrated dough should stick together when you squeeze it but crumble easily when you break it apart. (And will likely look a little like shredded meat or rice)
4. Place the dough in a plastic bag and let it rest for 30 minutes.
5. After 30 minutes, if there is any air in the bag, remove it.
6. Foot knead the dough until flat and even and about 1/4 - 1/2 inch thick.
7. Let the dough rest for 30 minutes.
8. Dust the work surface with potato starch.
9. Cut the dough into strips that are slightly narrower than the width of the pasta machine.
10. Roll out the dough by hand liniarly to about the widest setting on the pasta machine.
11. With a modern western pasta machine laminate the dough:
   1. Roll the dough out with a rolling pin until it is thin enough to fit through the machine.
   2. Run the dough through the machine on the widest setting.
   3. Fold the dough in half and run it through the machine again.
   4. Repeat this process 5-6 times.
   5. Gradually decrease the thickness setting on the machine and run the dough through each setting 2-3 times.
12. Go to the desired thickness setting on the pasta machine (usually 1.5mm to 1mm)
13. Fold and cut the sheet to the desired length of the noodles.
14. Dust the noodles with potato starch to prevent sticking while cutting the noodles.
15. Run the noodles through the pasta machine slowly to cut them.
    1.  If the sheets are too wide then the edges will be a little wonky discard these. (To avoid this when cutting the dough originally make sure to cut them slightly narrower than the width of the pasta machine)
16. Store in a rigid container that is dusted with potato starch.
17. Ideally let the noodles rest in the fridge for 24 hours before cooking.
18. Store in the fridge for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months.

## Technical Notes
### Hydration
Hydration is the ratio of water to flour in the dough. It is expressed as a percentage of the weight of the water to the weight of the flour. For example, a dough with 40% hydration would have 40 grams of water for every 100 grams of flour. The hydration level of the dough will affect the texture of the noodles. A higher hydration dough will be softer and chewier, while a lower hydration dough will be firmer and more brittle. The hydration level of the dough can be adjusted by adding more or less water to the flour.

This number should be calculated with all the wet ingredients in the dough. This includes the kansui and any other liquids that are added to the dough, as well as eggs.

#### Recipe alterations
All the ingredients in the dough should be calculated based on the weight of the flour. 

### Laminating the dough
Laminating the dough is the process of folding the dough in half and running it through the pasta machine multiple times. This process helps to develop the gluten in the dough and create a smooth, elastic texture. It also helps to create layers in the dough, which will give the noodles a chewy texture when cooked. This is an important step in making ramen noodles, to align the gluten, so be sure to take your time and do it properly.
