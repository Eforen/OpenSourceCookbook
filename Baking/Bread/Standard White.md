# Notes
1. First Attempt at this recipe trying to recover my bread recipe
   * This worked fairly well but it was a little more dence then I want
   * I will try going up to a 17% fat and 1.5% salt and a hydration of 65% next time
2. 2nd attempt at this recipe
   * Taste was good
   * Under did not kneed 2 of the lofes enough (I need to kneed them much more)
   * The bread fell apart to easy I believe there was to much fat % in the recipe I only used 190g butter for the 4 lofes so I think maybe I should go down to around 95g butter and leave the oil about the same
